Full dataset of speech and song, audio and video (24.8 GB) available from [Zenodo][1].  Construction and perceptual validation of the RAVDESS is described in our Open Access [paper in PLoS ONE][2].\n\nCheck out our [Kaggle Song emotion dataset][3].\n\n**Files**\n\nThis portion of the RAVDESS contains 1440 files: 60 trials per actor x 24 actors = 1440.   The RAVDESS contains 24 professional actors (12 female, 12 male), vocalizing two lexically-matched statements in a neutral North American accent. Speech emotions includes calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust expressions. Each expression is produced at two levels of emotional intensity (normal, strong), with an additional neutral expression.\n\n**File naming convention**\n\nEach of the 1440 files has a unique filename. The filename consists of a 7-part numerical identifier (e.g., 03-01-06-01-02-01-12.wav). These identifiers define the stimulus characteristics: \n\n*Filename identifiers*\n\n - Modality (01 = full-AV, 02 = video-only, 03 = audio-only).\n\n - Vocal channel (01 = speech, 02 = song).\n\n - Emotion (01 = neutral, 02 = calm, 03 = happy, 04 = sad, 05 = angry, 06 = fearful, 07 = disgust, 08 = surprised).\n\n - Emotional intensity (01 = normal, 02 = strong). NOTE: There is no strong intensity for the \u0027neutral\u0027 emotion.\n\n - Statement (01 = \u0022Kids are talking by the door\u0022, 02 = \u0022Dogs are sitting by the door\u0022).\n\n - Repetition (01 = 1st repetition, 02 = 2nd repetition).\n\n - Actor (01 to 24. Odd numbered actors are male, even numbered actors are female).\n\n\n*Filename example: 03-01-06-01-02-01-12.wav* \n\n1. Audio-only (03)\n2. Speech (01)\n3. Fearful (06)\n4. Normal intensity (01)\n5. Statement \u0022dogs\u0022 (02)\n6. 1st Repetition (01)\n7. 12th Actor (12)\nFemale, as the actor ID number is even.\n\n**How to cite the RAVDESS**\n\n*Academic citation* \n\nIf you use the RAVDESS in an academic publication, please use the following citation: Livingstone SR, Russo FA (2018) The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS): A dynamic, multimodal set of facial and vocal expressions in North American English.
